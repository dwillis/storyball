## IRE 2024 Conference
#### Derek Willis, University of Maryland

Some of the best sports data stories start with a good question. How about this one: which women's college basketball teams benefit the most from home-court officiating?

First, we'll load the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Our data is game-level records from the 2017-18 season through 2023-24 season. After loading it, we'll want to add columns to measure the foul differential between the two teams, and I'll through in steal differential, too, since that's often associated with aggressive defense.

```{r}
logs <- read_csv("logs1824.csv")

logs <- logs |> mutate(foul_diff = TeamPersonalFouls-OpponentPersonalFouls, steal_diff = TeamSteals- OpponentSteals, turnover_diff = TeamTurnovers- OpponentTurnovers)
```

Let's take a look at our data so we can get familiar with it.

## Averages for all teams

```{r}
logs |> filter(!is.na(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> group_by(HomeAway) |> summarize(avg_fouls = mean(TeamPersonalFouls))
```

Then, we'll start our group_by and summarize work, for teams and conferences, thanks to `pivot_wider`:

```{r}

team_fouls_location_season <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, Team, Season, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

conference_fouls_location_season <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, Season, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

team_fouls_location <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, Team, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)


conference_fouls_location <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(TeamPersonalFouls)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

team_fouldiff_location_season <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(foul_diff)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, Team, Season, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(foul_diff)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

conference_fouldiff_location_season <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(foul_diff)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, Season, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(foul_diff)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

team_fouldiff_location <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(foul_diff)) |> 
  group_by(Team, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(foul_diff)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)

conference_fouldiff_location <- logs |> 
  filter(!is.na(foul_diff)) |> 
  group_by(Conference, HomeAway) |> 
  summarize(avg_fouls = mean(foul_diff)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = HomeAway, values_from = avg_fouls) |> 
  rename(Home = `NA`, Away = `@`, Neutral = N) |> 
  mutate(Diff = Home-Away)
```

### How many teams have averaged fewer fouls at home and away over the past seven seasons?

```{r}
team_fouldiff_location_season |> 
  filter(Home < 0, Away < 0) |> 
  group_by(Team) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

### Teams that are good at this - are they alike? Yes, except South Carolina, NC State and Western Illinois.

```{r}
team_fouldiff_location |> 
  filter(Away < 0, Home < 0) |> 
  select(Team, Away, Home, Diff) |> 
  arrange(Diff)
```

What about West Virginia? Let's check [the graphic from Her Hoop Stats](https://herhoopstats.substack.com/p/for-wvu-theres-no-place-like-home).

Ok, that's kind of weird.

### Drilling down into game-level data for West Virginia

This excludes neutral court games.

```{r}
logs |> 
  filter(Team == "West Virginia", !is.na(W_L), is.na(HomeAway)) |>  
  select(Season, Date, Opponent, W_L, foul_diff, steal_diff, turnover_diff) |>  
  arrange(desc(Date)) |> 
  distinct()
```
