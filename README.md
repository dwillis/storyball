A hands-on session on finding sports data at IRE 2024

## Where to Find Raw Data

#### GitHub

GitHub hosts lots of public repositories filled with various sports data. There are collections of data mostly scraped from other websites. For example:

* [College Rosters](https://github.com/Sports-Roster-Data/) (WBB and Volleyball)
* [MLS Soccer Rosters](https://utdata.github.io/mls-roster-profiles/)
* 

## Where to Find Data for Use in R

#### sportsdataverse

sportsdataverse is a set of R packages that provide access to data from multiple professional sports (and a few college ones).
